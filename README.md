## Project Description
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/cookiecatsgame">Cookie Cats</a> is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by <a href="http://tactile.dk">Tactile Entertainment</a>. It's a classic "connect three"-style puzzle game where the player must connect tiles of the same color to clear the board and win the level. 
Here's a brief video showcasing the game demo: https://youtu.be/GaP5f0jVTWE.

As players progress through the game from one level to the next, they will occasionally encounter gates that force them to wait a non-trivial amount of time or make an in-app purchase to progress.

## Main Objective
Analyze an A/B test and determine if the gate should be moved from level 30 to level 40

## Data Source
The dataset is publicly available on Datacamp, which can be retrieved from https://www.datacamp.com/projects/184.
